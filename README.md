## Tech Stack

**Backend:** Node.js · Express · MongoDB (Mongoose) · JWT Auth · Socket.IO · Nodemailer · Cloudinary · Razorpay · node-cron  
**Frontend:** React 18 · Redux Toolkit · React Router v6 · Tailwind CSS · Vite · Socket.IO client · Recharts  
**Tooling:** Concurrently · Nodemon · ESLint

### Third-party services — dev-mode fallbacks

Every third-party integration below runs in a **mock/local mode by default** so the app is fully runnable without any paid accounts. See [Manual setup steps](#manual-setup-steps-for-production-credentials) for how to swap in real credentials.

| Service | Used for | Without credentials |
|---|---|---|
| Nodemailer | Verification/reset/notification emails | Auto-creates a free Ethereal test inbox; preview URL logged to console |
| Cloudinary | Avatars, portfolio images, resumes, chat files, dispute evidence | Falls back to local disk storage under `backend/uploads/`, served at `/uploads/*` |
| Razorpay | Escrow/milestone payments | Falls back to an in-process mock gateway that simulates orders/captures/refunds |
| Google OAuth | "Continue with Google" login | Button is present but login will fail until `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` is set |
| Hugging Face | AI job-matching scores | Falls back to a local skill-overlap + rating similarity algorithm |

## Week 1 Features — Authentication & User Management

- User registration with roles: `client`, `freelancer`, `admin`
- JWT login / logout
- Protected and public routes
- Profile management (name, bio, skills, avatar)
- Redux auth slice with localStorage persistence
- Role-based access control middleware
- Dashboard layout with responsive Sidebar + Navbar
- **Email verification** — signup sends a 24h verification link; unverified users see a "Resend email" prompt on their profile
- **Password reset** — `/forgot-password` emails a 1h reset link; `/reset-password/:token` sets a new password
- **Two-factor authentication (2FA)** — optional per-account toggle in Profile → Security; when enabled, login emails a 6-digit one-time code that must be verified before a session token is issued
- **Google OAuth login** — "Continue with Google" button on Login/Register verifies the Google ID token server-side and links or creates an account (requires `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, see [Manual setup steps](#manual-setup-steps-for-production-credentials))

---

## Advanced Search Engine

- **Freelancer directory** (`GET /api/users`, new "Find Freelancers" client-facing page) — filters by skill, city/country, hourly-rate range, minimum rating, and a minimum-experience proxy (completed review count, since the app has no separate "years of experience" field)
- **Location-based gig search** — `city`/`country` filters added to the existing `GET /api/gigs` (which already had skill/budget-range/status/keyword search from Week 2)
- **Uses plain MongoDB queries** (regex + range filters), not MongoDB Atlas Search or Elasticsearch — both are cluster-level features that can't be provisioned from application code; see [Manual setup steps](#manual-setup-steps-for-production-credentials) for how to layer Atlas Search on top of this later without changing the API shape

## Freelancer Availability Scheduler

- **Availability slots** — derived from `freelancerProfile.weeklyAvailability` (hours/day, set in Professional Profile), conventionally starting at 09:00 (documented simplification — the data model stores an hours-per-day count, not explicit time ranges)
- **Booking system** — `GET /api/bookings/availability/:freelancerId?date=` returns hourly slots marked available/booked; clients book directly from a freelancer's public profile
- **Automatic scheduling** — bookings are confirmed immediately if the slot falls inside the freelancer's availability window and doesn't conflict with an existing confirmed booking; no manual approval step
- New `/scheduler` page for both sides to view upcoming/past bookings and cancel

## Dispute Resolution System

- **Dispute request** — either the client or accepted freelancer on an in-progress/completed gig can raise a dispute against the other; notifies the other party and every admin
- **Evidence upload** — either party attaches files (Cloudinary/local-disk) while a dispute is `open`/`under_review`
- **Admin mediation** — admins review evidence and resolve with notes, either `resolved` or `rejected`; both parties are notified (email + real-time)
- Logged to `AdminLog` alongside the other admin actions

## Project Progress Tracker

- **Task completion percentage** — `Gig.completionPercentage`, auto-derived from approved-milestone ratio whenever a milestone payment is released, but overridable by the freelancer's own self-reported percentage in a progress update (documented trade-off: milestones are often too coarse-grained to reflect real-time progress, so a manual number takes precedence until the next milestone approval recomputes it)
- **Progress logs** — new `ProgressLog` collection; the accepted freelancer posts timestamped text updates (optionally with a percentage and a file deliverable) on an in-progress gig, visible to both parties as a timeline
- **File uploads** — each progress log can carry one attachment via the existing upload pipeline
- **Deadline reminders** — already covered by the `node-cron` job added during infrastructure work (daily sweep, 24h-out email + notification to both parties)
- Surfaced as a progress bar + timeline + post-update form on the gig detail page (visible once a gig is in-progress/completed)

## Security Hardening

Closes out the Week 4 timeline item:

- **Helmet** — standard security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, etc.). `contentSecurityPolicy` is explicitly disabled since its strict defaults would block the Razorpay Checkout script, Google Identity Services, and Socket.IO's dev-mode cross-origin polling; the other protections stay on.
- **Rate limiting** (`express-rate-limit`) — 300 req/15min on all `/api/*` routes as a general abuse backstop, tightened to 20 req/15min on `/api/auth/*` to slow down credential-stuffing/brute-force attempts
- **NoSQL injection prevention** (`express-mongo-sanitize`) — strips `$`-prefixed operator keys from `req.body`/`req.query`/`req.params` before they reach any Mongoose query
- **Request body size limits** — capped at 10mb on JSON/urlencoded bodies (file uploads already had their own per-type limits from the infrastructure commit: 5MB images, 10MB documents, 15MB generic)
- Pre-existing protections carried forward: bcrypt password hashing, JWT auth, role-based access control on every mutating route, Mongoose schema validation

## Freelancer Analytics Dashboard

New `/analytics` page (freelancer-only) pulling together data from across the app rather than a single collection:

- **Profile views** — `User.profileViews`, incremented by `GET /api/users/:id` (module 3)
- **Gig applications** — total proposal count + breakdown by status (pending/negotiating/accepted/rejected/withdrawn)
- **Earnings statistics** — total earned (sum of released payments) and amount currently in escrow
- **Monthly revenue chart** — released-payment totals grouped by month over the last 12 months (Recharts line chart)
- **Client feedback analytics** — average per-criterion rating (communication/quality/timeliness/professionalism) plus the overall weighted reputation score, reusing the review breakdown logic from module 8

## Admin Dashboard

All routes under `/api/admin/*` are admin-only (`authorizeRoles('admin')`), and every mutating action is written to a new `AdminLog` audit-trail collection.

- **Manage users** — search/filter by role, view reputation
- **Suspend accounts** — blocks login (checked in `authController.login`); admins can't suspend other admins
- **Verify freelancers** — grants the `freelancerProfile.isVerifiedBadge` shown on public profiles, notifies the freelancer
- **Approve/hide gigs** — `Gig.isApproved` gates whether a gig appears in the public `GET /api/gigs` listing (defaults `true` so existing gigs are unaffected; this is an extra moderation lever, not a hard pre-publish gate)
- **Payment monitoring** — every transaction platform-wide with status and mock/live mode
- **Fraud detection** — surfaces reviews the automated heuristics (module 8) flagged, with the reason
- **Admin analytics**: platform revenue (sum of released payments), active freelancers (accepted a proposal in the last 30 days), top skill categories (bar chart), job success rate (`completedGigs / (completedGigs + closedGigs)`)
- Fixed a pre-existing bug: the admin sidebar's "All Users" link pointed at `/my-gigs` (a leftover from when the admin nav was scaffolded) — it now correctly points at the new admin pages

## AI-Powered Job Matching

Goes beyond simple skill-tag filtering (PDF Module 2's example: a client posts a React job and the system should surface the top nearby, best-fit freelancers):

- **Skill similarity scoring** (`backend/src/utils/skillSimilarity.js`) — uses the Hugging Face Inference API (`sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` embeddings, cosine similarity) when `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY` is set; otherwise falls back to local Jaccard similarity over normalized skill sets. Falls back automatically on any API error too, so matching never breaks because of a flaky third party.
- **Freelancer recommendations for a gig** — `GET /api/matching/gigs/:gigId/recommendations` scores every freelancer as `0.6×skillSimilarity + 0.25×weightedReputation + 0.15×locationMatch` (same city > same country > none) and returns the top 10. Surfaced on the client's Gig Proposals page with one-click invite.
- **Personalized gig recommendations for freelancers** — `GET /api/matching/recommended-gigs` scores open gigs as `0.85×skillSimilarity + 0.15×recency` against the freelancer's skills. Surfaced as a "Recommended For You" strip on Browse Gigs.
- **Trending skills detection** — `GET /api/matching/trending-skills` aggregates `skillsRequired` across gigs posted in the last 30 days; shown as clickable filter chips on Browse Gigs.
- Added optional `location {city, country}` to `Gig` (mirroring `User.location`) to power the hyperlocal part of matching.

## Freelancer Professional Profiles

A dedicated "Professional Profile" page (freelancer-only, linked from the sidebar) extends the basic profile with:
- Skills with a proficiency level (beginner/intermediate/advanced/expert) — separate from the simple tag-style `skills` list used for search/matching, to avoid disrupting the existing profile editor
- Portfolio gallery (image upload + title/description/project link)
- Resume upload
- Certifications (name, issuer, year, credential URL)
- Work experience timeline
- Weekly availability calendar (hours/day) — feeds the availability scheduler
- Hourly rate + milestone-pricing acceptance toggle
- Verification badge (`freelancerProfile.isVerifiedBadge`) — set by an admin from the Admin Dashboard, not self-service
- Profile view counter, incremented whenever someone other than the owner views `GET /api/users/:id` (feeds the freelancer analytics dashboard)

Basic identity fields (name, avatar, bio, tag-style skills, city/country location) stayed on the original Profile page.

## Week 2 Features — Gig Marketplace & Proposal System

### Gig Marketplace
- Clients can create, edit, delete, and manage gigs
- **Budget ranges** — gigs store `budgetMin`/`budgetMax` (was a single number); search matches on range overlap
- **Milestones** — clients define named milestones with an amount and due date when creating/editing a gig; each tracks its own `pending → in-progress → completed → approved` status (feeds the Payments and Progress Tracker modules)
- **Document attachments** — clients upload/remove files on a gig (spec docs, briefs) via the Cloudinary/local-disk upload pipeline
- **Freelancer invites** — clients invite a specific freelancer by email from the gig detail page; the freelancer gets a real-time + email notification and sees it on their new "Invitations" page
- Browse all open gigs with search, filter, and pagination
- Filter by skill, budget range, status, and keyword search
- Gig statuses: `open` → `in-progress` → `completed` / `closed`
- Gig detail page with client info, skills required, milestones, and attachments

### Proposal System
- Freelancers can submit proposals on open gigs
- One proposal per freelancer per gig (duplicate blocked)
- Proposal fields: cover letter, bid amount, estimated days
- Client can accept or reject individual proposals from the new **Gig Proposals** page (`/gigs/:id/proposals`, linked from My Gigs and the gig detail page) — the accept/reject backend already existed but had no frontend UI until now
- **Price negotiation** — either party can counter-offer via `PUT /api/proposals/:id/negotiate`; each counter is appended to `negotiationHistory` and the proposal moves to a `negotiating` status; accepting a negotiated proposal locks in the last countered amount as the final `bidAmount`
- Accepting a proposal auto-rejects all other pending/negotiating proposals
- Accepting a proposal moves gig status to `in-progress`
- Freelancers can withdraw pending proposals
- Notifications fire on proposal received/accepted/rejected/countered (real-time + email for accept)

### Smart Reputation & Review System
- Reviews are gated on a **completed gig with an accepted proposal** linking reviewer and reviewee — there's no path to review someone you didn't actually work with
- **Weighted reputation score** (`utils/reputationScore.js`) instead of a plain average: reviews on higher-budget gigs (proxy for significant work) count more, and reviews older than 180 days are down-weighted — recomputed and denormalized onto `User.reputationScore`/`reviewCount` whenever a non-flagged review is created
- Optional per-criteria sub-ratings (communication, quality, timeliness, professionalism) surfaced as a breakdown on the public profile
- **Fraud detection**: reviews are flagged (excluded from the score, kept for audit) when a reviewer posts 3+ reviews within 10 minutes, or repeats identical comment text — flagged reviews stay in the database with `flagged`/`flagReason` for the admin module to act on
- New public profile page (`/users/:id`) shows a freelancer's or client's bio, skills, portfolio, experience, weighted rating, and full review list
- `GET /api/gigs/:id` now also returns `acceptedFreelancer` once a gig is in-progress/completed, so both parties (and future chat/payment features) know who they're paired with without needing owner-only proposal access

### Real-Time Chat & Collaboration
Built on the Socket.IO server added in the infrastructure commit:
- Instant messaging between any two users, optionally scoped to a gig, via a new `/messages` page (sidebar-linked for every role)
- Conversations + message history persisted (`Conversation`, `Message` models) and loaded via REST on open; new messages stream over `message:send`/`message:new` Socket.IO events
- File sharing — upload via `POST /api/conversations/:id/attachments`, then sent as a message attachment
- Typing indicators (`typing:start`/`typing:stop`) and read receipts (`message:read`, tracked per-message in `readBy[]`)
- A user only gets a persisted "new message" notification if they're not already viewing that conversation's room — avoids spamming the bell while actively chatting
- "Message" buttons added to the gig detail page (client ↔ accepted freelancer) and the public profile page
- WebRTC video calls (listed as *optional* in the spec) were **not** implemented — deliberately out of scope for this pass; the conversation model is ready to carry a `call:*` signaling event set if added later

### Notification System
- Bell icon in the navbar (every role) with an unread-count badge, dropdown list, "mark all read", and click-to-navigate via each notification's `link`
- Backed by the `Notification` model + `notify()` helper added during infrastructure work — this commit adds the missing list/read REST API and the frontend UI that actually surfaces them
- Real-time delivery via the `notification:new` Socket.IO event (prepends to the dropdown live); REST fetch on load covers the history
- Notification types wired so far: proposal received/accepted/rejected/negotiated, review added, message received, gig invite, deadline reminders (cron job) — payment events, dispute events, and gig-approval land with their respective modules below. "New gig posted" as a broad skill-matched alert to freelancers is covered instead by the AI job-matching recommendations feed (module 2) rather than a per-gig blast notification.

### Secure Payment System
- **Escrow flow**: client pays into escrow (`created` → `escrow`) → freelancer marks the milestone complete → client releases funds (`escrow` → `released`) or refunds before releasing (`escrow` → `refunded`)
- **Milestone payments**: one `Payment` per milestone (or one for the whole gig if it has none), driven from a payments panel on the gig detail page
- **Razorpay test mode with a built-in mock fallback** (`backend/src/config/razorpay.js`): with no `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`/`SECRET` set, orders/signature-verification/refunds are all simulated in-process — the full escrow flow works end-to-end with zero real money or external calls, clearly labeled "mock mode" in the UI. Add real **test-mode** keys to exercise the actual Razorpay Checkout widget.
- **Automatic freelancer payout** is simulated as the `release` step — real payouts require a separate KYC'd RazorpayX account, which is out of scope here; swap in RazorpayX transfers behind `releasePayment` when ready.
- **Refund management** — client-initiated refunds on any not-yet-released escrow
- **Transaction history** — `/payments` page (client and freelancer both see their side) with escrow/earned totals

### Dashboard Analytics

- **Week 4** ✅ Payments, admin dashboard, scheduler, disputes, progress tracker, freelancer analytics, security hardening

All 15 modules from the project spec are implemented — see each section above for details and [Manual setup steps](#manual-setup-steps-for-production-credentials) for what's mocked vs. needs real credentials.

### Infrastructure (chore)

Foundational plumbing added ahead of the features that depend on it:
- Nodemailer email service (`backend/src/config/email.js`, `backend/src/utils/sendEmail.js`) with automatic Ethereal fallback in dev
- File upload pipeline (`backend/src/utils/uploadFile.js`, `backend/src/middleware/uploadMiddleware.js`) — Cloudinary if configured, else local disk under `backend/uploads/` served at `/uploads/*`
- Socket.IO server (`backend/src/socket/index.js`) — JWT-authenticated sockets, per-user rooms for notifications, per-conversation rooms for chat (messaging, typing indicators, read receipts)
- `Conversation`, `Message`, and `Notification` Mongoose models plus a shared `notify()` helper (`backend/src/utils/notify.js`) that every feature (proposals, payments, reviews, etc.) will push through consistently
- Daily deadline-reminder cron job (`backend/src/jobs/deadlineReminderJob.js`, `node-cron`) — notifies client + assigned freelancer 24h before an in-progress gig's deadline
- Frontend Socket.IO client wrapper (`frontend/src/services/socket.js`) and upload-URL resolver (`frontend/src/utils/resolveFileUrl.js`)

## Manual setup steps for production credentials

These are optional in development (everything has a working fallback) but required before a real deployment:

1. **Email** — set `EMAIL_USER`/`EMAIL_PASS` in `backend/.env` to a real SMTP account (e.g. a Gmail App Password) so verification/reset/notification emails reach real inboxes.
2. **Cloudinary** — create a free account at cloudinary.com, set `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`.
3. **Razorpay** — create a Razorpay account, generate **test-mode** keys first, set `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`/`RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`. Swap for live keys only after a real go-live review.
4. **Google OAuth** — create an OAuth Client ID in Google Cloud Console (Web application), add `http://localhost:5173` as an authorized origin, set `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` in both `backend/.env` and as `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` in `frontend/.env`.
5. **Hugging Face (optional)** — set `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY` to use a hosted embedding model for job matching instead of the local fallback.
6. **MongoDB Atlas** — replace `MONGO_URI` with your Atlas connection string for a shared/production database.
7. **MongoDB Atlas Search (optional)** — once on Atlas, you can define a search index over `Gig`/`User` and swap the regex-based queries in `gigController.getGigs`/`userController.searchFreelancers` for a single `$search` aggregation stage for fuzzy/typo-tolerant search — the request/response shape wouldn't need to change.
